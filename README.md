# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple and fun dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play the game [here](https://ajayjangir95211.github.io/Pig-Game/).

## Game Rules

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their current score.
3. If the player rolls a `1`, all their current score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', meaning their current score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.
